The video discusses five data science projects that are relevant for the job market in 2026, moving beyond classic beginner projects (0:00-0:14). The speaker, an experienced professional from Google and Microsoft, emphasizes building end-to-end, business-aligned projects that showcase understanding of problems, data, tradeoffs, and impact (1:25).

Here are the projects discussed:

Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis (2:26-4:28): This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, segmenting users, and predicting churn and customer lifetime value. It involves working with real datasets like telecom churn or online retail data, applying techniques like RFM analysis, and building churn prediction models. The emphasis is on interpreting results and making business-driven decisions, such as who should receive retention offers or early access to features.

Demand Forecasting / Time Series Modeling (4:28-7:03): This project involves forecasting demand, usage, or traffic using time series data. It's applicable to various industries like retail (inventory), energy (consumption), and airlines (passenger demand). The process includes exploring trends and seasonality in datasets like Walmart sales or energy consumption, building multiple models (ARMA, SARMA, Prophet, LSTM), comparing their performance, and explaining the business impact of better predictions.

NLP-Based Insights from Unstructured Data (7:03-9:26): This project goes beyond basic sentiment analysis to extract valuable insights from unstructured text data such as product reviews, customer support tickets, or earnings call transcripts. It involves building systems for retrieval and summarization, topic classification, or clustering recurring issues. The project emphasizes using modern tools like embeddings (Sentence Transformers, OpenAI embeddings) and vector databases, and evaluating the usefulness and actionability of the system's output.

Experimentation & Uplift Modeling (9:26-11:47): This project focuses on understanding and analyzing A/B tests and control rollouts, which are crucial for shipping features in tech companies. It involves finding datasets with treatment and control groups, running proper A/B test analysis, calculating metrics, and understanding statistical significance. A key differentiator is estimating uplift, identifying which users benefited most from a treatment, and making clear, justified decisions based on the analysis (e.g., whether to ship a feature or roll it out to specific segments).

End-to-End ML System with Deployment (11:47-13:40): This project covers the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training and evaluation to deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. It involves picking a practical problem (e.g., predicting ride cancellations, fraud detection), tracking experiments (MLFlow, Weights & Biases), evaluating with business-sensible metrics, and deploying the model using tools like Streamlit, Gradio, or FastAPI. Crucially, it also emphasizes adding monitoring or a plan for how to detect performance degradation, handle data drift, and retrain the model.

Yes — **your approach is conceptually sound**, and you’re thinking about this problem at a *system-design + quantitative* level, which is excellent. 👍
What you’re essentially designing is a **News → NLP → Feature Engineering → Stock Impact Engine**.

Let me break this into:

1. ✅ Validation of your idea
2. 🧠 Improved architecture (practical + scalable)
3. 📊 How to turn news into numbers (robustly)
4. ⚖️ Weighting, decay & time aggregation
5. ⚠️ Pitfalls & realism
6. 🏗 Suggested tech stack

# ✅ Is your approach okay?

**Yes.** In fact, hedge funds and quant firms do something very similar:

* News ingestion
* NLP extraction
* Feature scoring
* Time-decayed aggregation
* Stock-level impact mapping

Your idea of:

```
adani: [-1, -2, +2, 0, ...]
tcs:   [+1, 0, +1, -3, ...]
```

is basically a **feature vector per stock over time**.
That’s a correct mental model.

However, to make it reliable, you’ll want to structure it more formally.

## 1) Data Ingestion Layer

Sources:

* News sites
* Google News
* RSS feeds
* Twitter/X (optional later)

Output:

```json
{
  "article_id": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "content": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "source": "ndtv"
}
```

---

## 2) NLP Extraction Layer

Use an LLM or fine-tuned transformer to extract structured facts:

```json
{
  "sentiment": -0.6,
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "entities": ["Adani Group", "cement", "government"],
  "sectors": ["infrastructure", "cement"],
  "event_type": "tax_increase",
  "by_government": true
}
```

💡 Important:
Use **normalized values** instead of raw -5 to +5 initially.

Example:

```
sentiment ∈ [-1, +1]
confidence ∈ [0,1]
```

Later you can scale.

---

## 3) Feature Generator (Your "Numbers")

Instead of one single score, generate multiple features:

```
f1 = sentiment
f2 = relevance_to_stock
f3 = confidence
f4 = government_flag
f5 = event_severity
```

Then compute:

```
news_impact_score =
sentiment *
relevance *
confidence *
severity *
gov_multiplier
```

Example:

```
sentiment = -0.7
relevance = 0.9
confidence = 0.8
severity = 1.2
gov_multiplier = 1.3

impact = -0.7 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 1.2 * 1.3 ≈ -0.79
```

This becomes one data point for Adani.

---

## 4) Stock Impact Mapper

You maintain:

```
Company → sectors → keywords → subsidiaries
```

Example:

```
Adani:
  cement
  ports
  power
  infra
```

If article sectors overlap → relevance increases.

---

# 📊 Better Representation Than Simple Lists

Instead of:

```
adani: [-1, -2, -1, 0, +2]
```

Use:

```
adani:
  09:00 -> -1.3
  11:00 -> -0.4
  14:00 -> +0.2
```

Store as **time series**.

This allows:

* Moving averages
* Momentum
* Trend detection

---

# ⚖️ Time Decay & Re-Scoring (Your Weight Idea)

You’re correct that older news should matter less.

Use **exponential decay**:

```
weight = e^(-λ * hours_since)
```

Example:

If λ = 0.2

| Hours Old | Weight |
| --------- | ------ |
| 0         | 1.0    |
| 3         | 0.55   |
| 6         | 0.30   |
| 12        | 0.09   |

Final score at time T:

```
score(T) = Σ (impact_i * weight_i)
```

This naturally handles:

✔ Old news fading
✔ New news dominating

---

# 📈 Final Stock Signal

At every checkpoint:

```
if score > +0.5 → Bullish
if score < -0.5 → Bearish
else → Neutral
```

Optionally combine with price indicators:

```
final_signal =
0.6 * news_score +
0.4 * technical_score
```

This dramatically improves performance.

# ⚠️ Hard Truths (Very Important)

### 1. News ≠ Market Reaction

Markets sometimes:

* Ignore bad news
* Pump on bad news
* Dump on good news

So always treat news as **probabilistic**, not deterministic.

---

### 2. Entity Resolution Is Hard

"Adani Power" vs "Adani Green" vs "Adani Group"
You’ll need a mapping table.

---

### 3. LLM Costs

Processing thousands of articles with LLMs can be expensive.

Solution:

* First filter with cheap models
* Then send only relevant articles to LLM

---

# 🏗 Suggested Tech Stack

### Scraping

* Python + Scrapy / Playwright

### NLP

* HuggingFace transformers
* OpenAI / open-source LLMs

### Storage

* PostgreSQL (metadata)
* TimescaleDB or InfluxDB (time series)

### Pipeline

* Kafka / RabbitMQ
* Or simple Celery workers

### Backend

* Python FastAPI

# 🧪 MVP Version (Simple First)

Start with:

1. Google News scraper
2. Single LLM call per article
3. Only 5 stocks
4. Hourly aggregation

Once stable → scale.

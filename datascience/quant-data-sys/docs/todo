1. i am not happy with the current implementation.
2. it doesnt use the browser connection
3. i want enterprise grade code.
4. i want retry mechanism, playwright is costly, so yeah, there will be retry, cool down retries
5. there will be parallel processing.
6. i will implement a queue, so that i can process things in parallel, and this http client will be injected to sevrice as they will get used.
7. i want things to be async, everything as async.
8. headless browser will run somewhere else, so yeah. playright wont install chromium, everything will be via websocket

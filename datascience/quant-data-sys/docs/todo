i want a  filter. when a link comes for scrapping, i want to exclude links of certain patterns.

it will be a injectatble thing, maintain a proper class, and if the link url or link body contains anything of that, like it will be two layer. first is the link itself, second is the body, if the link got scrapped, and then it matches my filteration function call, silenty skip it, no need to save anything for that.
